# Password-Manager
This is a project on password management which is made using python. I have made use of Fernet module which helps in encrypting texts. I have encrypted the passwords so that even if someone gets the access to the "passwords.txt" file still they won't be able to view the passwords. The user can add passwords in the file for future reference instead of memorising it which helps them manage their password's in a much efficient way.
